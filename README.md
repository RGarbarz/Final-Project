# Final-Project
GC Content Analysis to Detect Pathogenicity of E. coli

Project Question: Can pathogenic genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer be identified in E. coli using GC content patterns? 


Approach: Using NCBI GenBank and Ensembl, we will gather E. coli genomic sequences from three environments: human gut, clinical sample, and contaminated water. We will compute GC content for whole genomes and use a 500 base pair sliding window to identify and compare GC-rich/poor regions.
